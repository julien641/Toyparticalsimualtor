Make sure you switch to the GNU compiler with OpenMPI before compiling or
running MPI jobs.  You can do this by running `source modules.sh`.

School work for parallalization, ran on a super computer. 
The goal was to optimize the Partical collider.
For the linear solution I distributed the particle in hash table where the key would be based on their x and ys and would check their surrounding bin
For the parallel solution i used my orignal solution but to re distribute the particles i used a lock for each bin which majorily improved the performance.
